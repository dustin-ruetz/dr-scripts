# make git detect all text files and auto-normalize them (convert 'crlf to' 'lf')
# declare this setting first so that subsequent lines can override it
* text=auto

# these file types are text; they should be normalized
# "Git will run CRLF to LF replacement on these files every time they are
# written to the object database, and the reverse replacement will be run
# when writing out to the working directory."
